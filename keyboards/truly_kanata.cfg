;; This configuration language is Lisp-like. If you're unfamiliar with Lisp,
;; don't be alarmed. The maintainer jtroo is also unfamiliar with Lisp. You
;; don't need to know Lisp in-depth to be able to configure kanata.
;;
;; If you follow along with the examples, you should be fine. Kanata should
;; also hopefully have helpful error messages in case something goes wrong.
;; If you need help, you are welcome to ask.

;; Only one defsrc is allowed.
;;
;; defsrc defines the keys that will be intercepted by kanata. The order of the
;; keys matches with deflayer declarations and all deflayer declarations must
;; have the same number of keys as defsrc. Any keys not listed in defsrc will
;; be passed straight to the operating system.
