# agents/

Role contracts for long-lived sub-agents.

## Files
- `game-architect.md`
- `survivor-operator.md`
- `pr-governor.md`

## How to use
- Read `AGENT.md` first (repo-wide policy).
- Then read the role file for role-specific scope, inputs/outputs, and operating rules.
- Keep one canonical PR per issue slice across all roles.
